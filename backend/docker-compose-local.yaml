# Docker does not copy the file from your local machine into the image.
# Instead, Docker mounts the file at runtime, meaning:
  # The container sees your local file as if it were a native file inside its filesystem.




# context: ../
# The build.context in a docker-compose.yml file is crucial 
# because it tells Docker what files to send to the Docker engine when building your image.
# This tells Docker:

# Use the root python-full-stack/ directory as context (where pyproject.toml, etc. live)

# Use the Dockerfile inside backend/
